## Process Apache Combined logs  

This is **very specific** to Hosting downloads of Shoes from your website which you can do if you really want to.
When you do, you might want to know if its being used or how it's abused. So I wrote this. 

It sucks something awful: I'm just a hack and I really don't know or like SQL. Not a good combination.

But, it does show how to use Sqlite3 in Ruby (which could be Shoes code and I
know that some Shoes folk do use SQL)

## Problems? 

Too many to count. Can you help? Of course you can.
